# Anti-Pitch

Nothing is perfect. If React Native for web isn't right for your next project, then it's better for everyone if you don't use it! Here are some reasons that React Native for web may not be the right fit.

### **New-ish**

At the time of writing this, the community is relatively small. This isn't as big a deal breaker as it is for something like Flutter but it could become problematic. Most of the questions you'll have will overlap with either React DOM, React Native, or just JavaScript in general. But if you run into an issue with something you aren't very comfortable with like Babel or Webpack then you better hope it's day time in California :D

### **Not enough universal libraries**

### Webpack is hard

### Tree Shaking is too fragile

### The name "React Native for web" is scary

### My project is complete and I don't need to rewrite it
