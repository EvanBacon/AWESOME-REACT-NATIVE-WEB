# CSS Animations

## What can it do?

CSS Transitions enable us to create implicit transitions similar to techniques like "magic move". You can define how you want the transition to take place and the final position, but the browser is responsible for interpolating the values. 

## How can I use them?

Implementing CSS Transitions is as easy as defining new styles.
