# React Native Web Tips

React Native is a very powerful framework that can enable you to build cross-platform mobile apps. But now with React Native for web you can create universal apps that run everywhere! 

React Native for web was created by [Nicolas Gallagher](https://github.com/necolas) to build the Twitter Lite PWA. I've been integrating it into the Expo eco-system so that any complex native API \(with web support\) can be used in a universal capacity. 

I've collected web specific React Native information into this one location to ease the entry or conversion process.

If you have any questions feel free to tweet at me [@Baconbrix](https://mobile.twitter.com/Baconbrix) or [@Expo](https://mobile.twitter.com/Expo).
